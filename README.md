# This is an Arduino ADC engine sound generator - for quick project

ORIGINAL PROJECT IS DEPRECATED! 
See new ESP32 version: https://github.com/TheDIYGuy999/Rc_Engine_Sound_ESP32
It's based on the ATmega 328 version: https://github.com/TheDIYGuy999/Rc_Engine_Sound

## Features:
- Based on V 1.0, cleaned SPI and PWM stuff. easier to use.

### Compiling the new sketch:
- compile and upload the sketch in Arduino IDE
- the new engine should now run...

## Schematic:
I'll add soon, Using hoverboard bluetooth sound module.
